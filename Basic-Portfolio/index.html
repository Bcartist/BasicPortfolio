    <p>I will be using this an a portfolio for what I have learned. I started my journey into the world of tech
        the beginning of 2022. In January , I learned <strong>very</strong> little html for four days. Feburary, I 
        stopped completely because my personal life was very hectic. It wasn't until Mid-March I decided to study 
        everyday for at least an hour. I average around 15-25 hours a week of studying mainly html and css. <br><br> Granted,
        as a kid I use to change my Tumblr layout with html and css, but it was mostly alot of copying and pasting.

    <p>The first project I implemented a link tree onto my personal art portfolio website.
    The idea was given to me by my collaborator and I wanted to do it myself before asking for help. 
    A great thing this coding this has taught me is to be more confident in my own skill. Although
    I have only been studying for two weeks, I was able to create a simple link tree that fit the theme
    of my site without any help. My collaborator did send me his code to study and he has showed me that 
    I can start putting what I learn into pratice. Doing is the best way for someone like me to learn , I 
    have always been a visual learner.
